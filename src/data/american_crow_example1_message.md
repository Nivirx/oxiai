The American crow is a large passerine bird species native to North America, known for its black plumage and distinct calls. Adults typically measure 40-50 cm (16-20 in) from beak to tail and weigh between 300-600 g (11-21 oz), with males slightly larger than females. They are highly intelligent, adaptable, and often found in various human environments. The American crow can be distinguished from other similar corvid species by its size, beak shape, and call patterns. This bird is a common and widespread species across North America, serving as a useful bioindicator for diseases such as the West Nile virus.
